## ❓ FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### Is this safe to use?
**Yes!** The app is completely open source (all code is visible on GitHub). It doesn't collect any data, doesn't store your password, and only saves your login session cookie - exactly like using Messenger in a web browser.

### Do I need to log in every time?
**No!** After your first login, the app remembers your session. You'll stay logged in until you manually log out.

### Can I use multiple accounts?
Not currently. You'll need to log out and log back in to switch accounts. Multi-account support may come in a future update!

### Why does Windows show a security warning?
The app is not "code signed" (a digital signature that costs $300+/year). This is normal for free open-source software. Click "More info" → "Run anyway" to install.

### Will my messages be private?
**Absolutely!** This app is just a window to messenger.com - your messages go directly to Facebook's servers, exactly like using Messenger in Chrome or Edge. The app doesn't read, store, or send your messages anywhere else.

### Does this work with Messenger Kids or Business?
This app is designed for personal Facebook Messenger accounts only.

### Can I use this on Mac or Linux?
Not yet - currently Windows only. Mac and Linux support is planned for future releases!

### How do I uninstall?
Go to Windows Settings → Apps → Find "Messenger Desktop (Unofficial)" → Click Uninstall
